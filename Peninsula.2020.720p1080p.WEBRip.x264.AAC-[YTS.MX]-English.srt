00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:13,967
Captain, where are you?

3
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:16,469
I'm heading there with my sister's family.

4
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:18,679
We're almost there, so hang on.

5
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:24,602
Is this the right way?

6
00:01:24,894 --> 00:01:26,729
I drove through here dozens of times.

7
00:01:27,396 --> 00:01:29,232
All the other roads would be packed with cars.

8
00:01:36,614 --> 00:01:37,740
Oh...

9
00:01:40,952 --> 00:01:43,329
Please give us a ride.

10
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,166
I have a little girl. I have a wife too.

11
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,752
Please take us to the port.

12
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:52,630
I'm begging you...

13
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,133
I wasn't bitten! It's not a bite!

14
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:03,807
If we look dangerous,
at least take our girl. Please.

15
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:05,434
Sir?

16
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:08,354
Please! I'm begging you!

17
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:10,273
Sir! Please!

18
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:14,861
Jung-seok...

19
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:17,989
Don't say anything until we're on the ship!

20
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:28,791
Can you tell us
why this dreadful virus has spread, Paul?

21
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,627
Well, unfortunately, we don't have much information

22
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:35,256
other than the fact that it started
out of a bio-factory in South Korea.

23
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:40,053
Uh, it's unclear exactly
how this unidentified virus initially began to spread.

24
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:43,890
Of course,
sheer pandemonium broke loose in South Korea.

25
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:46,475
And many people began to believe a rumor

26
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:47,894
that was circulating online

27
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:50,229
{\an8}about a safe region somewhere further down south...

28
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:52,731
{\an8}Busan? Is this the correct pronunciation?

29
00:02:52,815 --> 00:02:55,068
{\an8}That's right. People were evacuated there.

30
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:57,904
{\an8}But in the end, no place was truly safe.

31
00:02:57,987 --> 00:03:01,699
{\an8}But there is an absolute safe place
on the Korean Peninsula.

32
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,743
That's correct.
I believe you're referring to North Korea.

33
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:08,581
Perhaps it's fortunate
that this happened before the reunification!

34
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:09,916
So it turns out.

35
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:13,878
So how long before the Korean government
lost all control?

36
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:15,504
Just one day.

37
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,176
Please move slowly!

38
00:03:20,676 --> 00:03:22,511
This is Alpha One.

39
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:24,680
Move on!

40
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:25,764
Be careful!

41
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:40,779
This is Alpha Two.

42
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:42,698
We have about 50 civilians waiting for boarding.

43
00:03:58,882 --> 00:03:59,966
Uncle.

44
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:04,888
Are you all right, Dong-hwan?

45
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:06,305
Yes.

46
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:07,974
Where's Chul-min?

47
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:10,309
He went to get some relief aid.

48
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:15,398
But shouldn't we have arrived in Japan by now?

49
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,526
I'm sure we're almost there, don't worry.

50
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:21,070
Captain!

51
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:25,824
What is it?

52
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:27,869
We're being rerouted to Hong Kong.

53
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,204
Why all of sudden?

54
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,040
They're not telling me why.

55
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:35,793
I have to go check something.

56
00:04:48,932 --> 00:04:50,058
Excuse me.

57
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,312
I'll ask about it,
so go and check what's going on.

58
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,396
Yes, sir.

59
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:57,065
Excuse me.

60
00:04:57,481 --> 00:04:58,482
Excuse me.

61
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:06,199
Uh.

62
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,312
Sir!

63
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:38,689
Sir!

64
00:05:38,982 --> 00:05:41,109
Is it true that we are rerouting to Hong Kong?

65
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:42,986
Please return to your seats.

66
00:05:43,486 --> 00:05:45,571
We need to understand the situation, sir!

67
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,949
Everyone's getting nervous.

68
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:51,619
Please return to your seat
and await further instructions.

69
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:52,745
Sir!

70
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:53,872
We have a problem.

71
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:56,249
We've found an infected person
on the lower deck cabins.

72
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,834
We get ramen too?

73
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,089
Come in. Leave your bag here.

74
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:04,173
It looks good.

75
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,341
Please come in.

76
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,135
- Infected!
- What?

77
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:12,849
What is it?

78
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:10,073
It's okay, I'll be right here.

79
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:13,993
Breathe, Dong-hwan. I'm not going anywhere.

80
00:07:14,493 --> 00:07:15,661
It'll be okay.

81
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:17,746
Look at me.

82
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,628
I'll be right here with you.

83
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:31,177
What do I do?

84
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:35,348
Your uncle's here, Dong-hwan.

85
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:40,728
Sis...

86
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:43,106
- What do we do?
- We have to go.

87
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:44,523
We have to go now, come on!

88
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:47,861
- Let's go!
- Your uncle...

89
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:50,696
We have to go!

90
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,116
We must leave.

91
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,200
Come on!

92
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:57,078
Sis!

93
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,805
Sis! Sis!

94
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,363
Honey!

95
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:34,697
No!

96
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,986
There is even a case of infected hosts

97
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,948
that were found on the last lifeboats
to leave for Hong Kong.

98
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:16,699
After that, the neighboring countries

99
00:09:16,782 --> 00:09:19,953
decided to no longer accept any more refugees.

100
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:22,746
In effect, Korea became completely quarantined.

101
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:25,041
Yes, it's been four years already.

102
00:09:25,124 --> 00:09:26,834
Yes. Four years.

103
00:10:33,776 --> 00:10:34,986
Wake him up.

104
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:41,993
Hey! Wake up!

105
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:47,498
That's enough!

106
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:52,420
We are not here to fight.

107
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:54,255
The boss wants to see you.

108
00:10:57,425 --> 00:10:58,467
Hey!

109
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:34,378
Come on.

110
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:43,847
What are you doing here?

111
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:45,098
Let's leave.

112
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:46,182
Let go of me.

113
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,851
Hyung!

114
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:48,977
"Hyung."

115
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,563
It means "brother," doesn't it?

116
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:54,148
You two brothers? Huh?

117
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:55,566
No, no, no.

118
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,861
He is my dead wife's brother.

119
00:11:58,236 --> 00:11:59,445
Not brother.

120
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:02,448
That sounds like a real tragic story.

121
00:12:04,492 --> 00:12:05,534
Have a seat.

122
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:07,745
I don't know what the hell is it
with you people from the peninsula?

123
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:11,374
You, uh... have an air about you.

124
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,210
You have a lot of sad, sad tales...

125
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:16,629
Let's get down to business.

126
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:19,966
Should I say "your country"
or "the peninsula"?

127
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:22,593
Look, I, I heard a rumor...

128
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:26,472
There seems to be some people
that are going back down

129
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:29,851
into the peninsula
to make their own fate.

130
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:33,938
Zombies don't give a damn about all
that gold and money,

131
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:36,815
which is just laying around there unguarded.

132
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:39,318
I think it's ingenious.

133
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:40,444
Wow.

134
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,239
You want us to go back in there?

135
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:45,824
Have you lost your mind?

136
00:12:46,534 --> 00:12:47,743
My brother,

137
00:12:48,494 --> 00:12:51,539
my mind is completely sound, thank you.

138
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,831
Okay.

139
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,458
So...

140
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:57,836
the neighboring countries around the peninsula

141
00:12:57,921 --> 00:13:01,090
are controlling every ship
and plane that crosses the border.

142
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:04,135
How would you get in or out?

143
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:06,512
It's been done.

144
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:09,307
You don't need to worry about the coast guard.

145
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:11,767
As long as we keep paying them,

146
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:14,145
the ships go in, the ships go out.

147
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:18,274
As a matter of fact, technically,
we had the money and the truck.

148
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,651
Twenty million dollars.

149
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,320
Until we went missing halfway here.

150
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:23,654
Where was the last time we...

151
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:24,989
On the Omok Bridge.

152
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:26,115
Mok-dong?

153
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,201
What?

154
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:29,743
Look, I don't think it's too difficult.

155
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:31,412
You just go in at night,

156
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:33,915
you get the truck, come back with the money,

157
00:13:33,998 --> 00:13:36,625
and don't worry about those zombies.

158
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:39,378
I hear they are practically blind at night.

159
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:41,005
So...

160
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:43,967
How much money we get?

161
00:13:44,217 --> 00:13:45,218
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

162
00:13:46,886 --> 00:13:48,847
Well, that's the question, isn't it?

163
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:50,264
Half.

164
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:54,227
That is, if you come back alive.

165
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:59,023
That's 2.5 million dollars per head.

166
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:01,234
Now listen to me.

167
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,195
You have no idea when or even

168
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:09,492
if the government is ever going
to grant you any refugee status,

169
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:12,871
so you might as well make your own goddamn future.

170
00:14:12,954 --> 00:14:13,955
Think!

171
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:29,553
We just have to hop on a boat,
and bring the truck back.

172
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:30,972
What's so hard about that?

173
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,057
It'll only take half a day.

174
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:40,523
Are you nuts? You want to go back there?

175
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:46,404
Then do you want to keep living here,
getting treated like scum?

176
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,037
You should have let me die
with my son and wife!

177
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:55,704
Why did you do it?

178
00:14:56,705 --> 00:15:00,293
Had I let you die, everyone on
that ship would've died.

179
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:01,377
Am I wrong?

180
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:05,048
It was a sensible decision.

181
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:08,717
Sensible decision, my ass.

182
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:11,720
Did you even try?

183
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:15,391
Jung-seok...

184
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:18,477
You're tormented too!

185
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:22,106
You just gave up!

186
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:29,155
Whatever, forget it.

187
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:30,489
Okay.

188
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:34,368
Well, I'm going to go there,

189
00:15:34,452 --> 00:15:37,956
so you can do whatever you want.

190
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:41,125
Let's just not bump into each other.

191
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,419
It's hard for both of us.

192
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:45,713
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

193
00:15:46,464 --> 00:15:49,050
Aren't they bastards from the peninsula?

194
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:51,344
- What?
- Where the virus came from!

195
00:15:51,845 --> 00:15:53,972
Should you be letting them in here?

196
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:55,056
Move aside.

197
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,224
- Let go of me.
- Stop.

198
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:57,766
Do you even care about the others?

199
00:15:57,851 --> 00:15:58,893
Stop it.

200
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:01,520
Is he infected?

201
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:03,106
Come on. Stop.

202
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:05,149
I won't take your money, so just leave!

203
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:07,902
You go ahead.

204
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,187
You're entering the peninsula waters.

205
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:44,397
Turn back.

206
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,524
You're entering the peninsula waters.

207
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:47,608
Turn back.

208
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:50,444
This is Z055 Chungpyung.

209
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:55,158
- Hello?
- Hello?

210
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:57,743
It's all good if there's no response.

211
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:21,392
Almost there!

212
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:26,605
No need to be so serious.

213
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:28,691
Soon, you'll be rich!

214
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,651
Take what you need.

215
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:35,865
Don't forget, the zombies are blind at night
and sensitive to sound.

216
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,117
And the important thing.

217
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:43,706
We'll drop you off
and stay at sea nearby for three days.

218
00:17:48,252 --> 00:17:49,337
Take these.

219
00:17:50,296 --> 00:17:51,297
One for you.

220
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:54,968
And... another.

221
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:58,304
Call me when you get to the port with the truck

222
00:17:58,387 --> 00:18:00,348
and we'll pull up the boat.

223
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:06,229
And lastly!

224
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:10,358
You escaped out of there alive,
so you know better...

225
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,153
Don't screw up trying
to save each other for nothing.

226
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:16,572
Don't worry. We know.

227
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,991
Great!

228
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:19,825
Do not let us down.

229
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,671
It makes me nervous that you two know each other.

230
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:34,132
I know.

231
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:36,926
We have to pull this off no matter what,

232
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,345
so don't let your personal emotions
get mixed up in the way.

233
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,681
We won't even see each other after this,
so don't worry.

234
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:45,434
Fine.

235
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:47,061
Whatever, man.

236
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:19,195
GOD HAS FORSAKEN US

237
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:41,092
We're not on a tour, you know.

238
00:20:42,093 --> 00:20:45,221
Let's hurry things along,
we should leave before sunrise.

239
00:20:45,972 --> 00:20:47,640
All right, let's get it over with.

240
00:20:47,723 --> 00:20:49,225
Jeez.

241
00:20:54,022 --> 00:20:55,189
Is it working?

242
00:20:57,733 --> 00:20:59,110
Nice!

243
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,341
It's unrecognizable now. My goodness.

244
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:25,719
The city became a ruin in just four years.

245
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,763
Did you live near here?

246
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:31,642
I used to drive a cab.

247
00:21:32,143 --> 00:21:34,812
So I pretty much know all the roads.

248
00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:38,691
At the very least,
those jerks put together a good team.

249
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,704
A HEALTHY, CAREFREE COUNTRY

250
00:22:14,643 --> 00:22:15,895
Could that be it?

251
00:22:16,145 --> 00:22:17,313
Where?

252
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:20,608
The plate number is 6431, right?

253
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:22,401
We'll find out soon.

254
00:22:22,986 --> 00:22:24,904
You stay here, I'll go alone.

255
00:22:24,988 --> 00:22:26,030
What?

256
00:22:26,114 --> 00:22:27,991
Hey, hey, hey! Wait!

257
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:35,599
Come on, come on, come on!

258
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:38,019
What's with you?

259
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:40,021
Is that the truck?

260
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:41,898
No, it isn't.

261
00:23:43,607 --> 00:23:45,734
It should be nearby.
Let's look around a bit more.

262
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:16,057
There, I see one more.

263
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:19,268
Let's check it out.

264
00:24:20,436 --> 00:24:21,687
Okay.

265
00:24:40,623 --> 00:24:44,335
I'll go have a look. You stay here.

266
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:45,419
Stop it!

267
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:47,171
I'm not on a tour, you know.

268
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:49,090
We'll go together.

269
00:24:49,632 --> 00:24:50,633
Mister.

270
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,801
Let's take a look.

271
00:25:14,323 --> 00:25:15,699
Are they Unit 631?

272
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:19,745
No. They're not.

273
00:25:21,998 --> 00:25:23,917
Jackpot, we found it.

274
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:50,693
It was true...

275
00:25:54,072 --> 00:25:56,074
What they said was true.

276
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:58,284
It's all in US dollars. How much is all this?

277
00:25:59,118 --> 00:26:00,870
We confirmed it, so let's get going.

278
00:26:02,956 --> 00:26:03,957
Okay.

279
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:06,292
Jeez.

280
00:26:08,127 --> 00:26:10,421
Hey! Over here!

281
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:16,219
He must've been the last person to make contact.

282
00:26:18,762 --> 00:26:20,473
How unfortunate.

283
00:26:20,974 --> 00:26:22,934
He could've been a millionaire.

284
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:24,894
But it's good for us.

285
00:26:25,186 --> 00:26:26,645
Let's pull him out and go.

286
00:26:29,107 --> 00:26:31,317
Oh, jeez...

287
00:26:32,526 --> 00:26:33,527
He stinks...

288
00:26:35,446 --> 00:26:37,698
Move your leg. Thank you.

289
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,242
Thank you.

290
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:50,879
Idiots.

291
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:01,722
Are you okay?

292
00:27:02,181 --> 00:27:03,892
I'm fine, I wasn't bitten.

293
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,527
Gosh, what are they up to?

294
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,543
Get in the car, go!

295
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:34,505
Back it up!

296
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:26,850
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

297
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:27,976
Come on, come on, come on!

298
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:29,143
All right!

299
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,855
Let's go!

300
00:28:31,855 --> 00:28:33,147
Go! Go!

301
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:42,531
We're clear, we're clear!

302
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,867
Thank you...

303
00:28:44,783 --> 00:28:47,370
So the money's really there?

304
00:28:48,412 --> 00:28:50,414
You're a millionaire!

305
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:53,667
Yes!

306
00:28:53,751 --> 00:28:55,378
Awesome!

307
00:28:55,753 --> 00:28:57,088
What will you do with the money?

308
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:58,631
Me? Uh...

309
00:28:58,714 --> 00:28:59,840
Maybe I'll hire a chauffeur.

310
00:28:59,924 --> 00:29:01,675
Like a real millionaire!

311
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:07,598
So we just have to get
to the harbor and call them in.

312
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:10,977
This is a piece of cake!

313
00:29:12,937 --> 00:29:14,147
Give me the satellite phone.

314
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,940
Huh? Sure, hold on.

315
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:29,745
Here.

316
00:29:32,165 --> 00:29:33,416
What's that?

317
00:29:54,478 --> 00:29:55,521
Just drive!

318
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:57,523
Go, go, go! Just go!

319
00:31:43,837 --> 00:31:45,089
Hop in, if you want to live.

320
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:52,430
Sorry!

321
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:21,417
You must've been scared.

322
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:26,714
Yu-jin, I told you not
to act so friendly to strangers.

323
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:29,092
Sit back properly.

324
00:34:19,368 --> 00:34:20,786
Dang, he passed out.

325
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,456
Did I not tell him to buckle up?

326
00:34:28,044 --> 00:34:30,796
Joon-i, can you drive through them?

327
00:34:32,924 --> 00:34:33,967
I'm not sure.

328
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:37,846
Then what? Do I need to get involved?

329
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:27,979
Ooh...

330
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:29,438
Ooh.

331
00:35:40,116 --> 00:35:41,325
Uh?

332
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:50,751
Really?

333
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,881
The ground was weird, it wasn't my fault.

334
00:35:56,215 --> 00:35:57,716
Oh.

335
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:32,501
I really liked that one, though.

336
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:02,031
CITY NIGHT CLUB

337
00:37:44,073 --> 00:37:46,492
It's a grocery truck. Nice.

338
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,786
It looks new.

339
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:55,709
- Who's that?
- He's alive!

340
00:37:58,337 --> 00:38:01,090
- Please, help me...
- Be careful.

341
00:38:01,299 --> 00:38:04,886
- Be careful.
- Help me, I'm begging you...

342
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:10,516
Help me, please.

343
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:12,226
What the hell's going on?

344
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:14,145
He's just an infected, you jerks.

345
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,771
Have you never seen one before?

346
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:17,315
Please...

347
00:38:17,398 --> 00:38:19,192
It's all right, come here.

348
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:44,383
Sir, please, help me...

349
00:38:44,467 --> 00:38:47,053
I'm begging you...

350
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:53,184
- Give it to me.
- Here you go!

351
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,396
Sir...

352
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,985
Nice shot!

353
00:39:02,193 --> 00:39:03,736
Wow, he killed him properly.

354
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:05,654
Damn it!

355
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:09,658
It got on my pants. I should get it washed.

356
00:39:10,326 --> 00:39:11,327
Here.

357
00:39:12,495 --> 00:39:13,746
Let's get back, the sun will rise.

358
00:39:14,288 --> 00:39:15,289
Shit...

359
00:39:15,664 --> 00:39:18,126
- Let's go.
- The zombies are coming!

360
00:39:20,669 --> 00:39:22,380
Huh?

361
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:44,944
You little rascals!

362
00:39:45,278 --> 00:39:48,531
You brought something dangerous instead
of what you were supposed to get.

363
00:39:48,656 --> 00:39:49,698
Hey!

364
00:39:50,283 --> 00:39:53,827
You'd have been locked up for insubordination
if it were the old days!

365
00:40:00,543 --> 00:40:01,835
Lieutenant Yoon! Captain Hwang!

366
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,921
Assemble!

367
00:40:03,421 --> 00:40:04,838
Aren't you going to make a report?

368
00:40:04,923 --> 00:40:06,424
Did you get what I asked?

369
00:40:06,715 --> 00:40:09,385
Salute! Division commander, we did not get it!

370
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:12,346
Hey!

371
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,015
How could you not get it?

372
00:40:14,098 --> 00:40:16,309
The ROK-US Combined Forces Command
is waiting for my call!

373
00:40:16,392 --> 00:40:17,685
Without batteries...

374
00:40:17,768 --> 00:40:18,895
Come on!

375
00:40:18,978 --> 00:40:20,563
- Are you having fun?
- Joon-i!

376
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:22,648
- Captain Hwang!
- Grandpa!

377
00:40:23,274 --> 00:40:25,193
How long will you go on with that army stuff?

378
00:40:25,276 --> 00:40:26,277
Aren't you sick of it?

379
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,611
No, it's for real this time!

380
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:30,281
The newly appointed Major Jane
is totally different.

381
00:40:30,364 --> 00:40:31,991
She and I get along.

382
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:35,036
And it seems like we'll get rescued soon.

383
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,496
Listen to me, I'm good friends with her, so...

384
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,540
- Stop it! I'm sick of it!
- Yu-jin, you believe me, right?

385
00:40:39,623 --> 00:40:40,624
Who are you?

386
00:40:43,586 --> 00:40:45,964
I guess you've never experienced
a wild dog hunt before.

387
00:40:46,047 --> 00:40:47,548
You should've known that such trucks

388
00:40:47,631 --> 00:40:49,217
would attract their attention.

389
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,634
"Truck"?

390
00:40:50,718 --> 00:40:52,053
Who's that?

391
00:40:52,136 --> 00:40:53,137
Mom!

392
00:40:58,309 --> 00:41:02,480
Sir! Please!

393
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:07,193
He was almost caught by Unit 631.

394
00:41:08,402 --> 00:41:09,778
You went outside again?

395
00:41:10,404 --> 00:41:12,115
I convinced her to go.

396
00:41:12,198 --> 00:41:13,782
Why don't you ever listen to me?

397
00:41:15,576 --> 00:41:16,744
I'm sorry, Mom.

398
00:41:18,496 --> 00:41:21,082
They're batteries. Grandpa, she got batteries!

399
00:41:22,791 --> 00:41:24,710
Okay! Okay!

400
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:28,422
They fit.

401
00:41:28,506 --> 00:41:30,508
Hi, Jane? Jane? Major Jane?

402
00:41:31,092 --> 00:41:33,636
Oh, Jane! Oh, Jane! Okay!

403
00:41:35,471 --> 00:41:36,680
Are you okay?

404
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:39,392
- I'm okay! Yeah!
- You should turn it on.

405
00:41:39,475 --> 00:41:40,894
We are strong soldiers! No problem!

406
00:41:40,977 --> 00:41:42,228
I'm Yu-jin!

407
00:41:44,522 --> 00:41:45,606
When are you coming?

408
00:41:45,689 --> 00:41:47,942
- So people still live here...
- They said they're coming!

409
00:41:49,735 --> 00:41:50,819
Who are you?

410
00:41:51,445 --> 00:41:52,780
Are you with Unit 631?

411
00:41:56,742 --> 00:41:58,786
I don't know what 631 is.

412
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:02,831
I came to Incheon by boat yesterday.

413
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:05,209
From Hong Kong.

414
00:42:05,668 --> 00:42:06,669
What?

415
00:42:07,795 --> 00:42:09,255
From where?

416
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:22,185
Damn, the sun is rising.

417
00:42:23,602 --> 00:42:25,271
Let's hurry up.

418
00:42:30,443 --> 00:42:31,945
The third platoon is returning!

419
00:42:32,028 --> 00:42:33,404
Open the gate!

420
00:42:43,164 --> 00:42:45,624
There are one, two, three,
four, five, six boxes of cookies.

421
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,210
That's all correct.

422
00:42:49,587 --> 00:42:50,922
Scrap soup again?

423
00:42:51,214 --> 00:42:52,340
Eat if you want to live.

424
00:42:52,423 --> 00:42:55,509
That looks good. Have a great meal!

425
00:42:55,593 --> 00:42:57,553
Have a nice meal. Have a nice meal.

426
00:42:59,763 --> 00:43:01,390
The third platoon is back!

427
00:43:01,474 --> 00:43:02,808
They're here!

428
00:43:12,776 --> 00:43:16,489
- They're back!
- They're here!

429
00:43:18,157 --> 00:43:20,368
Great work, everyone.

430
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:22,120
Look! Isn't it awesome?

431
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:23,829
- Yeah!
- It sure is.

432
00:43:23,913 --> 00:43:25,539
My boys worked so hard!

433
00:43:25,623 --> 00:43:27,959
Bring us a can of tuna, that's all I ask!

434
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:29,252
- I'm sorry, sir...
- No, bring one.

435
00:43:29,335 --> 00:43:30,962
We were told to keep a tight lid on supplies.

436
00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:33,506
If I keep handing out stuff,
there won't be anything left.

437
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:34,798
And Captain Seo is...

438
00:43:35,383 --> 00:43:36,550
One can is too much?

439
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,801
That's not it...

440
00:43:38,136 --> 00:43:39,137
Bring it.

441
00:43:39,387 --> 00:43:40,429
They're serving food at the cafeteria.

442
00:43:40,513 --> 00:43:41,514
Get it!

443
00:43:41,597 --> 00:43:42,681
I said bring it!

444
00:43:42,932 --> 00:43:44,350
So I should just have scraps?

445
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,643
That's not...

446
00:43:45,726 --> 00:43:46,727
Do you want it?

447
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:49,188
I have to report to Captain Seo first.

448
00:43:49,813 --> 00:43:51,274
Just bring it, asshole!

449
00:43:52,483 --> 00:43:56,529
Report to a guy who's never even fought before?

450
00:43:56,946 --> 00:43:58,281
He's my commander.

451
00:43:58,364 --> 00:44:00,408
- Sergeant...
- Piss off, you bastard!

452
00:44:02,076 --> 00:44:03,827
- What was that?
- I'm talking here!

453
00:44:04,203 --> 00:44:05,704
- What was that?
- Hello?

454
00:44:06,122 --> 00:44:09,042
- Where is it coming from?
- I heard something.

455
00:44:12,045 --> 00:44:13,504
- What? A person?
- Hang on.

456
00:44:13,587 --> 00:44:16,132
Sir, we have a wild dog here.

457
00:44:16,966 --> 00:44:17,967
- What?
- Get him.

458
00:44:18,259 --> 00:44:19,552
What's a wild dog?

459
00:44:21,888 --> 00:44:23,264
Are you soldiers?

460
00:44:23,764 --> 00:44:26,142
Help me, I'm not from here.

461
00:44:27,268 --> 00:44:28,269
Get up, you bastard.

462
00:44:28,352 --> 00:44:29,812
Has the game started?

463
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:31,064
It hasn't, sir.

464
00:44:31,147 --> 00:44:32,690
Take him to the arena.

465
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:34,817
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go!

466
00:44:36,194 --> 00:44:37,904
We have a new player!

467
00:44:42,575 --> 00:44:46,996
Keep sucking up to Captain Seo,
and I'll kill you both.

468
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,081
Got that?

469
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:51,960
You little...

470
00:44:55,004 --> 00:44:56,130
Hey! Hey!

471
00:44:57,131 --> 00:44:58,549
He probably wasted all the flares

472
00:44:58,632 --> 00:45:00,134
without knowing what to get.

473
00:45:00,634 --> 00:45:01,719
That idiot.

474
00:45:02,136 --> 00:45:05,932
He brought so much useless crap last time.

475
00:45:10,937 --> 00:45:12,146
What the hell?

476
00:45:12,563 --> 00:45:14,357
We are strong soldiers!

477
00:45:14,648 --> 00:45:15,942
Strong! Strong!

478
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,111
Strong. Strong.

479
00:45:19,362 --> 00:45:21,489
No one ever came to rescue us in four years,

480
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:24,200
but some chump change was all it took?

481
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,454
What about your group?

482
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:34,418
They're all dead.

483
00:45:36,295 --> 00:45:37,380
Everyone.

484
00:45:39,757 --> 00:45:40,967
We got a fresh one!

485
00:45:55,523 --> 00:45:56,900
Hey there, cutie!

486
00:46:02,238 --> 00:46:03,614
Who were those soldiers?

487
00:46:03,697 --> 00:46:05,366
They're called Unit 631.

488
00:46:06,117 --> 00:46:08,369
They used to be a military unit dispatched
to rescue civilians.

489
00:46:08,912 --> 00:46:10,829
You were with them?

490
00:46:10,914 --> 00:46:13,291
We lived there before we escaped.

491
00:46:13,374 --> 00:46:14,876
At first.

492
00:46:16,669 --> 00:46:18,171
They sent out SOS signals for a few years,

493
00:46:18,254 --> 00:46:19,380
which were left unanswered.

494
00:46:20,589 --> 00:46:22,550
After that, they gave up everything,

495
00:46:22,675 --> 00:46:24,760
and now they're all crazy.

496
00:47:00,796 --> 00:47:02,131
Hm.

497
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:04,092
I'm leaving.

498
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:14,268
Yes?

499
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:25,779
Bang!

500
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,409
Awesome, that's great.

501
00:47:34,538 --> 00:47:36,916
I'm not someone who takes bribes, take it back.

502
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:38,960
Gosh, you're making me sad.

503
00:47:39,043 --> 00:47:41,087
I don't take bribes!

504
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,505
Look at it, it's Black Label.

505
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:46,300
Thanks, I was finishing my last drink.

506
00:47:47,218 --> 00:47:49,720
Here, accept my drink.

507
00:47:58,062 --> 00:47:59,397
Nothing to report again?

508
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,024
No, nothing happened.

509
00:48:01,607 --> 00:48:06,112
Sergeant Hwang stole a truck
from wild dogs overnight,

510
00:48:06,654 --> 00:48:09,949
and was boasting like crazy,

511
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:12,035
acting all high and mighty...

512
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:16,080
So where did our valiant sergeant go today

513
00:48:16,164 --> 00:48:18,707
and what adventure did he have?

514
00:48:20,834 --> 00:48:22,378
What did he bring in?

515
00:48:23,254 --> 00:48:26,007
Captain, that's the weird thing.

516
00:48:26,465 --> 00:48:28,134
The truck was full of US dollars.

517
00:48:28,217 --> 00:48:29,343
US dollars?

518
00:48:30,386 --> 00:48:31,387
How much?

519
00:48:32,305 --> 00:48:34,515
It was quite a bit.

520
00:48:34,891 --> 00:48:37,977
About 20 bags full of them.

521
00:48:38,561 --> 00:48:41,605
But why do you think those idiotic wild dogs

522
00:48:41,689 --> 00:48:44,859
were transporting completely useless money?

523
00:48:47,611 --> 00:48:48,863
Where is it now?

524
00:48:50,114 --> 00:48:51,908
So they took the truck.

525
00:48:52,658 --> 00:48:53,910
What about the satellite phone?

526
00:48:54,702 --> 00:48:56,745
It should be by the driver's seat.

527
00:49:05,213 --> 00:49:08,257
Sir, I'm not from here!

528
00:49:09,467 --> 00:49:11,552
I'm from Hong Kong!

529
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,555
This is brand new.

530
00:49:14,638 --> 00:49:16,432
It's rare. Today is your lucky day.

531
00:49:16,515 --> 00:49:17,725
Got anything else?

532
00:49:17,976 --> 00:49:20,686
I have... a satellite phone!

533
00:49:22,063 --> 00:49:25,358
With a satellite phone,
we can all get out of here!

534
00:49:26,275 --> 00:49:27,818
- Show us!
- Right here!

535
00:49:28,194 --> 00:49:30,529
- You lying sack of shit!
- He doesn't have it!

536
00:49:35,618 --> 00:49:38,121
Where do you think they
were heading with this money?

537
00:49:45,419 --> 00:49:47,130
Sir, where's the truck?

538
00:49:48,381 --> 00:49:49,715
Stop that!

539
00:49:50,049 --> 00:49:51,300
Stop! Please!

540
00:49:53,344 --> 00:49:54,888
Ah...

541
00:50:02,979 --> 00:50:04,063
He's really fresh!

542
00:50:04,147 --> 00:50:07,233
This guy's in good shape. He's a Grade A!

543
00:50:10,778 --> 00:50:11,905
Can you run well?

544
00:50:12,488 --> 00:50:13,489
No?

545
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,869
What should his number be?

546
00:50:17,952 --> 00:50:19,245
Give him Park Chan-ho's number.

547
00:50:19,328 --> 00:50:20,329
Number 61!

548
00:50:20,413 --> 00:50:21,747
Number 61 it is!

549
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:25,793
Major League pitcher!

550
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,586
That's a great number!

551
00:50:32,466 --> 00:50:33,592
Turn around!

552
00:50:36,554 --> 00:50:38,932
I'm betting a chocolate bar on him.

553
00:50:44,103 --> 00:50:46,189
Sir, where's the truck?

554
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:01,454
Sir! I'm not from here!

555
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,040
There's money in the truck! Go check it out!

556
00:51:04,123 --> 00:51:07,001
We can all leave if we have that, you idiots!

557
00:51:28,022 --> 00:51:29,023
What...

558
00:51:34,195 --> 00:51:35,238
Hello?

559
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:36,822
Where are you? The sun is out.

560
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,366
What's going on?

561
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,870
Hello. Who are you?

562
00:51:42,161 --> 00:51:43,162
What?

563
00:51:43,246 --> 00:51:44,538
Who the hell are you?

564
00:51:44,705 --> 00:51:45,957
Where's the money?

565
00:52:12,316 --> 00:52:13,526
Where are you going?

566
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:15,945
I don't think we should go out...

567
00:52:19,615 --> 00:52:21,700
Number 61! Get out!

568
00:52:23,452 --> 00:52:24,620
Get the hell out!

569
00:52:58,071 --> 00:52:59,572
I don't care who you are.

570
00:52:59,655 --> 00:53:00,656
Just bring the money.

571
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:03,034
The terms are the same
as the guys we sent in...

572
00:53:03,284 --> 00:53:06,454
Half the money to anyone
that brings it out. Okay?

573
00:53:07,163 --> 00:53:10,541
Are you saying we can get out of here?

574
00:53:10,624 --> 00:53:12,501
We are waiting around Incheon Port.

575
00:53:12,585 --> 00:53:14,128
You call me when you get there.

576
00:53:14,795 --> 00:53:15,838
It's so easy!

577
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,883
Easy, easy. I can do it. I can do it.

578
00:53:18,967 --> 00:53:20,009
All right.

579
00:53:27,516 --> 00:53:29,018
You can drive, right?

580
00:53:30,186 --> 00:53:32,188
Let's just go now, Mom.

581
00:53:33,147 --> 00:53:35,149
I'll bulldoze them all with my car.

582
00:53:37,776 --> 00:53:40,654
You'll just go in there? In broad daylight?

583
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:57,815
Run faster!

584
00:55:17,376 --> 00:55:21,380
It's time for us. To say goodbye

585
00:55:21,755 --> 00:55:24,217
Let's meet again soon

586
00:55:25,718 --> 00:55:29,722
It's time for us. To say goodbye

587
00:55:30,056 --> 00:55:32,641
Let's meet again soon

588
00:55:35,353 --> 00:55:36,562
Hey, buddy!

589
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:39,398
If you don't hurry, the doors will shut!

590
00:56:06,675 --> 00:56:07,927
You must be tired.

591
00:56:08,094 --> 00:56:09,345
You did great.

592
00:56:09,428 --> 00:56:10,804
How about a feast?

593
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:12,431
You want it? Really?

594
00:56:13,557 --> 00:56:15,226
Have some ramen!

595
00:56:15,643 --> 00:56:17,896
Eat slowly! Share them with your friends!

596
00:56:17,979 --> 00:56:19,272
Greedy bastards.

597
00:56:24,485 --> 00:56:25,611
You should share them!

598
00:56:27,571 --> 00:56:30,867
It's too dangerous now.
Let's move after sundown.

599
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:33,619
I think we can go now, though...

600
00:56:34,495 --> 00:56:36,080
Go? Go where?

601
00:56:37,456 --> 00:56:39,876
Grandpa, we're moving. Let's pack up.

602
00:56:40,168 --> 00:56:41,210
Move?

603
00:56:41,752 --> 00:56:42,753
Where?

604
00:56:42,836 --> 00:56:44,547
We're going to Incheon Port.

605
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:46,257
Incheon Port? Are we going to ride a boat?

606
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,341
Okay!

607
00:56:47,425 --> 00:56:48,551
No, no, no!

608
00:56:48,968 --> 00:56:52,346
We must stay here until Jane
comes to rescue us.

609
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,223
It was so hard convincing her!

610
00:56:54,307 --> 00:56:56,976
If Major Jane is coming,
tell her to come to the port.

611
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,394
No way!

612
00:56:58,477 --> 00:56:59,854
You said you two are close.

613
00:57:00,646 --> 00:57:02,190
I guess you aren't.

614
00:57:02,982 --> 00:57:03,983
We're close.

615
00:57:04,192 --> 00:57:05,985
Okay, it's doable.

616
00:57:06,735 --> 00:57:08,196
Incheon? Incheon Port?

617
00:57:08,279 --> 00:57:10,364
- Grandpa, hurry!
- Okay.

618
00:57:12,951 --> 00:57:15,744
You'll take a crazy old man and little kids

619
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:19,790
to steal a truck from armed soldiers?

620
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:23,878
Then should I continue living here with my girls?

621
00:57:25,254 --> 00:57:27,131
If you're scared, stay here.

622
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,343
I'll give you this place at a cheap price.

623
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,430
Get him a first aid kit,

624
00:57:35,264 --> 00:57:37,391
and get some sleep. We'll leave after sundown.

625
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,662
Why did you save me earlier?

626
00:57:59,998 --> 00:58:02,458
I was going to leave, but she wanted to save you.

627
00:58:03,459 --> 00:58:07,255
Dad told us we should help the weak
before he went to heaven.

628
00:58:08,422 --> 00:58:10,299
You looked weak.

629
00:58:12,551 --> 00:58:14,512
Stop yapping and go to bed.

630
00:58:14,595 --> 00:58:15,596
No!

631
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,598
I'm going to bed soon too, so go to sleep!

632
00:58:17,681 --> 00:58:18,807
I don't want to!

633
00:58:19,225 --> 00:58:20,935
One! Two!

634
00:58:22,395 --> 00:58:23,521
She's always like that...

635
00:58:23,604 --> 00:58:25,148
She thinks she's so big now.

636
00:58:26,815 --> 00:58:28,401
Maybe we should've left you there.

637
00:58:29,027 --> 00:58:30,736
You're complaining when we saved you.

638
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,281
You look like a zombie.

639
00:58:39,328 --> 00:58:41,664
Mm...

640
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:45,001
How long does it take to get to Incheon Port?

641
00:58:45,084 --> 00:58:46,377
If we find an unobstructed route,

642
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,836
it'll only take thirty minutes.

643
00:58:48,171 --> 00:58:50,131
Thirty minutes, thirty minutes, thirty minutes...

644
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:52,633
What about zombies? Wouldn't it be dangerous?

645
00:58:52,716 --> 00:58:53,885
They bite and stuff.

646
00:58:53,968 --> 00:58:55,136
- Captain.
- Yes?

647
00:58:55,845 --> 00:58:57,638
We need to get out of here.

648
00:58:57,763 --> 00:58:59,640
Forget about the zombies!

649
00:59:00,558 --> 00:59:02,310
Should we bring Sergeant Hwang?

650
00:59:03,019 --> 00:59:05,563
He's more dangerous than the zombies.

651
00:59:05,646 --> 00:59:06,647
You're right.

652
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:09,275
I can keep the gatekeepers off our backs,

653
00:59:09,859 --> 00:59:13,404
but sharp-witted Sergeant Hwang
might get suspicious.

654
00:59:15,323 --> 00:59:17,158
Yes, you're right.

655
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:24,207
Then I just have to find a way
to distract him, right?

656
01:00:05,957 --> 01:00:07,500
Sir? Sir!

657
01:00:08,084 --> 01:00:10,419
Sir! Please!

658
01:00:10,962 --> 01:00:14,966
Sir! Please just take my girl!

659
01:00:18,469 --> 01:00:22,015
Jung-seok, why are you the only one alive?

660
01:00:56,382 --> 01:00:57,591
Put it down.

661
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:00,261
You'll drain the batteries.

662
01:01:04,765 --> 01:01:07,601
Did Major Jane say she's coming to Incheon Port?

663
01:01:07,685 --> 01:01:08,769
Huh?

664
01:01:11,856 --> 01:01:14,817
She should. She has to.

665
01:01:17,153 --> 01:01:19,405
She better rescue my little darlings.

666
01:01:19,864 --> 01:01:21,324
My treasures.

667
01:01:22,491 --> 01:01:24,202
Yu-jin and Joon-i,

668
01:01:25,411 --> 01:01:28,164
they're the beacon of hope in this hell.

669
01:01:31,084 --> 01:01:36,255
I'll get them out of this hell no matter what.

670
01:01:39,425 --> 01:01:42,136
Major Jane is coming, right?

671
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:04,868
Are you okay?

672
01:02:05,994 --> 01:02:09,663
We stole these when we fled. Take what you need.

673
01:02:13,001 --> 01:02:15,128
I actually saw you before.

674
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:16,921
I...

675
01:02:17,505 --> 01:02:20,925
came across your family
when I was fleeing to board the ship.

676
01:02:22,635 --> 01:02:24,345
You begged me to take your girl.

677
01:02:29,142 --> 01:02:31,019
Why are you telling me that now?

678
01:02:32,436 --> 01:02:33,479
Because you feel guilty?

679
01:02:34,563 --> 01:02:35,773
There were 31 cars.

680
01:02:36,858 --> 01:02:38,734
There were 31 cars that drove past us.

681
01:02:39,944 --> 01:02:41,863
I thought the first car would stop to help us.

682
01:02:42,446 --> 01:02:43,822
Or maybe the next one...

683
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:49,871
All 31 cars just drove by.

684
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:54,542
You're indebted to my girls.

685
01:03:00,173 --> 01:03:02,508
Yu-jin, I'm buttoning you up.
Stand up straight!

686
01:03:03,634 --> 01:03:06,804
Are we going on a boat ride now?

687
01:03:06,888 --> 01:03:09,891
Yes, we just have to get something first.

688
01:03:13,602 --> 01:03:14,770
What about my cars?

689
01:03:15,104 --> 01:03:17,606
No way, we can't take them all.

690
01:03:21,027 --> 01:03:22,403
Then just this one!

691
01:03:22,736 --> 01:03:23,779
Put it down.

692
01:03:23,863 --> 01:03:25,531
Please, just one!

693
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,867
Let me take one!

694
01:03:31,412 --> 01:03:32,455
Let's go.

695
01:04:23,047 --> 01:04:24,132
Joon-i.

696
01:04:24,883 --> 01:04:28,970
Stay here. If I'm not back by sunrise,
head back home.

697
01:04:29,595 --> 01:04:30,763
Just the three of us?

698
01:04:31,514 --> 01:04:32,723
What about you?

699
01:04:33,307 --> 01:04:34,600
How will you come home?

700
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:37,436
I'll find my way somehow,

701
01:04:37,561 --> 01:04:39,313
so don't worry and head home.

702
01:04:41,232 --> 01:04:45,694
And don't ever leave the car, got it?

703
01:04:47,738 --> 01:04:48,739
Answer me.

704
01:04:50,909 --> 01:04:51,910
Okay.

705
01:04:53,912 --> 01:04:55,371
Yu-jin, come here.

706
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:03,296
I'll be back soon. Listen to your sister, okay?

707
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,839
You'll really be back soon, right?

708
01:05:06,132 --> 01:05:07,508
Of course, I'll be right back.

709
01:05:19,938 --> 01:05:23,066
Commander, take good care of my girls.

710
01:05:28,196 --> 01:05:29,238
Let's go.

711
01:06:31,092 --> 01:06:33,511
It's an emergency exit that we found
when we lived here.

712
01:07:09,255 --> 01:07:10,464
What the hell?

713
01:07:28,482 --> 01:07:29,567
Is that it?

714
01:07:33,071 --> 01:07:34,572
Yes, that's the one.

715
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:37,158
Let's move quickly.

716
01:07:40,661 --> 01:07:42,496
Ah, ah, ah.

717
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:45,249
I brought good news.

718
01:07:47,293 --> 01:07:53,424
Last night, the third platoon led by Sergeant Hwang

719
01:07:53,507 --> 01:07:54,968
brought home a truck.

720
01:07:55,593 --> 01:07:59,848
There was enough food for everyone to eat

721
01:07:59,931 --> 01:08:01,474
for an entire month.

722
01:08:06,479 --> 01:08:08,522
You've worked so hard, I know you did!

723
01:08:08,606 --> 01:08:13,651
So tonight... there'll be an unlimited game

724
01:08:13,736 --> 01:08:15,446
for 24 hours!

725
01:08:18,074 --> 01:08:20,451
And remember.

726
01:08:20,909 --> 01:08:23,079
Have fun like there's no tomorrow.

727
01:08:23,204 --> 01:08:24,372
Have a great time!

728
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:31,544
There will be no tomorrow.

729
01:08:31,837 --> 01:08:35,591
Stop cheering. Doesn't he seem strange?

730
01:08:35,716 --> 01:08:36,842
I think he's high.

731
01:08:36,925 --> 01:08:39,387
I'm not sure. Let's enjoy this!

732
01:08:44,307 --> 01:08:46,853
Hey, look over there.

733
01:08:47,395 --> 01:08:48,521
Shouldn't we report that?

734
01:08:49,022 --> 01:08:52,025
There aren't that many. Why bother reporting?

735
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:54,152
Forget it, don't mind them.

736
01:09:28,519 --> 01:09:29,645
Listen.

737
01:09:30,438 --> 01:09:32,190
Since you owe my girls,

738
01:09:33,649 --> 01:09:35,651
do me a favor later.

739
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:53,836
Johnnie Walker Black Label!

740
01:09:57,173 --> 01:09:58,257
You're back.

741
01:09:59,675 --> 01:10:03,304
Are you supposed to have booze here?

742
01:10:03,387 --> 01:10:04,430
Well...

743
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:08,059
The game is about to start. What brings you here?

744
01:10:08,142 --> 01:10:11,020
I haven't seen your face in ages.

745
01:10:11,896 --> 01:10:14,983
Could I have a sip?

746
01:10:15,066 --> 01:10:16,400
Sure, help yourself.

747
01:10:16,484 --> 01:10:17,651
- Really?
- Sure.

748
01:10:18,694 --> 01:10:20,947
So why are you here?

749
01:10:21,114 --> 01:10:23,407
Do you have something to report?

750
01:10:23,491 --> 01:10:27,912
No, I was just curious
what gets you up in the morning.

751
01:10:29,956 --> 01:10:31,332
Hm?

752
01:10:38,214 --> 01:10:39,257
It's good?

753
01:10:39,465 --> 01:10:40,716
So good!

754
01:10:42,593 --> 01:10:45,889
If you love it that much,
you can take the bottle.

755
01:10:46,472 --> 01:10:47,723
It's my gift to you.

756
01:10:49,517 --> 01:10:51,269
- What's with you?
- What?

757
01:10:52,353 --> 01:10:55,523
I begged for some snacks
for my boys to boost morale,

758
01:10:55,606 --> 01:10:57,358
but all we got were scraps.

759
01:10:58,359 --> 01:10:59,944
You were acting so cheap.

760
01:11:01,779 --> 01:11:03,489
So why the sudden generosity?

761
01:11:04,657 --> 01:11:07,201
I think I told everyone with my speech earlier.

762
01:11:08,119 --> 01:11:12,540
We owe so much to you and your men...

763
01:11:12,623 --> 01:11:13,666
Bullshit!

764
01:11:17,086 --> 01:11:20,298
I was just kidding.

765
01:11:21,507 --> 01:11:25,469
Captain Seo, are you hiding something from me?

766
01:11:27,471 --> 01:11:29,348
No, of course not.

767
01:11:32,601 --> 01:11:33,853
Captain Seo, I...

768
01:11:36,522 --> 01:11:37,606
Private Kim?

769
01:11:38,983 --> 01:11:41,652
Do you visit Captain Seo's quarters frequently?

770
01:11:43,404 --> 01:11:45,865
No... I do not.

771
01:12:10,264 --> 01:12:12,683
Ah.

772
01:12:14,435 --> 01:12:15,603
You two are a thing?

773
01:12:17,146 --> 01:12:18,814
- Yes.
- My apologies!

774
01:12:21,275 --> 01:12:23,777
I'm so clueless.

775
01:12:24,612 --> 01:12:25,738
I'll leave you two alone.

776
01:12:26,906 --> 01:12:28,032
Just the two of you...

777
01:12:28,116 --> 01:12:30,326
Hm?

778
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:34,413
I'll tell the boys to avoid dropping in,

779
01:12:34,497 --> 01:12:35,664
so have a great time.

780
01:12:35,748 --> 01:12:39,252
Have a hot time, okay?

781
01:12:39,961 --> 01:12:41,004
All right.

782
01:12:41,795 --> 01:12:43,756
Love, love is...

783
01:12:45,674 --> 01:12:47,886
Sir, the preparation is done.
Shall we get to the truck?

784
01:12:47,969 --> 01:12:50,346
You go ahead. I have something to do first.

785
01:12:50,429 --> 01:12:51,430
Yes, sir.

786
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:55,768
Does he have a death wish or what?

787
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,866
Joon-i, look up ahead! Quickly!

788
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:20,960
It's a march.

789
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,056
That road is too close to Unit 631.

790
01:13:33,139 --> 01:13:34,849
Aren't we going to go greet Mom?

791
01:14:06,589 --> 01:14:07,798
The money is intact.

792
01:14:29,946 --> 01:14:32,949
Hey, can't you take me with you?

793
01:14:33,616 --> 01:14:35,076
I really want to get out of here.

794
01:14:36,327 --> 01:14:38,704
Go where? Who told you about that?

795
01:14:39,663 --> 01:14:42,625
I overheard Captain Seo talking
on the satellite phone.

796
01:14:43,376 --> 01:14:44,793
Please take me with you.

797
01:14:45,211 --> 01:14:46,545
Satellite phone?

798
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:48,464
Where did you get it?

799
01:14:48,839 --> 01:14:51,259
The wild dog we found in the truck had it.

800
01:14:52,093 --> 01:14:53,261
Private Kim!

801
01:14:53,344 --> 01:14:54,846
Aren't you going to see the game?

802
01:14:56,222 --> 01:14:57,640
Answer naturally.

803
01:15:00,768 --> 01:15:01,936
I'm all right.

804
01:15:02,436 --> 01:15:04,105
You always say that. Oh, right.

805
01:15:04,522 --> 01:15:07,108
That wild dog who came with the truck,

806
01:15:07,191 --> 01:15:08,817
that guy was no joke.

807
01:15:09,193 --> 01:15:12,446
He was struggling so much to survive.

808
01:15:13,614 --> 01:15:15,533
I bet all my canned goods on him!

809
01:15:16,409 --> 01:15:17,493
I'll see you later.

810
01:15:19,245 --> 01:15:20,829
Where is the phone now?

811
01:15:21,289 --> 01:15:22,790
It's not with me.

812
01:15:22,874 --> 01:15:24,458
Captain Seo has it. He'll be here soon.

813
01:15:28,587 --> 01:15:29,797
Get going.

814
01:15:30,839 --> 01:15:32,133
I can't wait long.

815
01:15:38,514 --> 01:15:41,559
Act naturally when that bastard comes, got it?

816
01:15:43,186 --> 01:15:44,270
Okay...

817
01:15:45,771 --> 01:15:48,232
Number 61!

818
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,256
What are you doing? Let's move!

819
01:16:14,217 --> 01:16:15,509
Captain...

820
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:18,512
Long time no see, Captain Seo.

821
01:16:20,223 --> 01:16:22,391
Min-jung, you were alive. Gosh.

822
01:16:23,434 --> 01:16:25,228
You have the satellite phone, right?

823
01:16:25,311 --> 01:16:26,437
Hand it over.

824
01:16:28,397 --> 01:16:29,648
The satellite phone...

825
01:16:30,316 --> 01:16:31,442
Give me a second.

826
01:16:32,276 --> 01:16:33,862
Mm. Oh.

827
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:48,667
Wasn't that a gunshot?

828
01:16:48,751 --> 01:16:50,503
Like hell it was. Just shut up and eat this tuna.

829
01:16:50,586 --> 01:16:51,629
Hey!

830
01:16:56,634 --> 01:16:57,676
Oh.

831
01:17:00,054 --> 01:17:01,139
Let's go get Mom.

832
01:17:18,114 --> 01:17:19,908
Look! That bastard!

833
01:17:24,787 --> 01:17:26,247
Gun! Get the guns!

834
01:17:29,833 --> 01:17:31,544
- Are you okay?
- Yes...

835
01:17:32,211 --> 01:17:33,212
Can you get up?

836
01:17:33,671 --> 01:17:35,589
Yes, I can get up. I can get up.

837
01:17:42,931 --> 01:17:44,182
Stay behind me.

838
01:17:46,809 --> 01:17:49,187
Hey, where did he go?

839
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,521
Jesus Christ...

840
01:17:52,773 --> 01:17:55,985
Min-jung, I was so worried...

841
01:17:58,071 --> 01:17:59,989
That's mine, give it back...

842
01:18:03,868 --> 01:18:04,911
Sergeant!

843
01:18:06,955 --> 01:18:08,622
Where did that bastard go?

844
01:18:12,919 --> 01:18:14,128
Go look for him.

845
01:18:21,594 --> 01:18:22,761
Block the entrance!

846
01:18:26,933 --> 01:18:27,976
Move!

847
01:19:17,942 --> 01:19:19,152
Fire! Fire!

848
01:19:46,262 --> 01:19:47,638
Hey. Go forward.

849
01:20:16,792 --> 01:20:17,793
Damn it!

850
01:20:17,961 --> 01:20:18,962
Jung-seok!

851
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:35,895
Sergeant!

852
01:21:19,939 --> 01:21:21,149
Come on!

853
01:22:05,318 --> 01:22:07,904
Hurry! Get in!

854
01:22:12,533 --> 01:22:14,410
Get in! Come on!

855
01:22:18,622 --> 01:22:19,999
Snap out of it!

856
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:21,960
Come on!

857
01:22:23,377 --> 01:22:24,462
Hurry!

858
01:22:44,858 --> 01:22:47,861
Go after them!

859
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:04,418
Captain, are you okay?

860
01:23:07,546 --> 01:23:08,714
What do we do now, sir?

861
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:13,094
Captain!

862
01:23:21,352 --> 01:23:23,021
You did all you can.

863
01:23:23,521 --> 01:23:24,813
That's what matters.

864
01:23:25,148 --> 01:23:26,274
Get it together.

865
01:23:51,215 --> 01:23:52,300
Sergeant Hwang!

866
01:23:54,302 --> 01:23:55,386
Step on it!

867
01:23:58,722 --> 01:24:02,560
It's time for us. To say goodbye

868
01:24:03,186 --> 01:24:05,229
Let's meet again soon

869
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:20,304
Grandpa, hurry!

870
01:25:20,679 --> 01:25:22,056
Okay!

871
01:25:25,476 --> 01:25:26,727
Open the window.

872
01:25:50,001 --> 01:25:51,377
Mom!

873
01:25:51,878 --> 01:25:54,505
We came to greet you!

874
01:25:54,588 --> 01:25:56,840
Why don't you ever listen to me?

875
01:25:58,092 --> 01:25:59,218
Come on!

876
01:26:13,232 --> 01:26:14,442
Yee-haw!

877
01:26:39,717 --> 01:26:41,845
- Hold on.
- Okay!

878
01:27:10,789 --> 01:27:15,879
Hey! Stop with the damn flares!
Just kill them all!

879
01:27:35,814 --> 01:27:36,941
They're behind us!

880
01:27:43,322 --> 01:27:44,490
Hold on tight!

881
01:27:58,004 --> 01:27:59,213
Come on!

882
01:28:09,265 --> 01:28:11,184
You asshole!

883
01:28:19,483 --> 01:28:20,693
He's not bad.

884
01:29:07,156 --> 01:29:09,117
Pull up closer, asshole!

885
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,618
This way, move up!

886
01:29:11,785 --> 01:29:12,786
Kill him!

887
01:29:28,302 --> 01:29:29,762
Watch the front, asshole!

888
01:29:30,138 --> 01:29:31,222
Hold the wheel!

889
01:29:33,224 --> 01:29:34,225
Hey!

890
01:29:44,443 --> 01:29:45,528
Turn on the lights.

891
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:12,471
To our right!

892
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,323
Beside you!

893
01:30:54,513 --> 01:30:55,514
Watch out!

894
01:31:40,977 --> 01:31:42,103
Hold on tight!

895
01:32:55,885 --> 01:32:57,220
Go over to the right!

896
01:33:28,459 --> 01:33:30,753
Hey! Back up, back up, back up!

897
01:33:36,509 --> 01:33:38,719
Back it up!

898
01:33:40,179 --> 01:33:43,099
I said back it up, asshole!

899
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:48,604
Just step on it!

900
01:33:49,688 --> 01:33:52,025
Back the shit up!

901
01:33:52,816 --> 01:33:54,693
What the hell are you doing? Back it up!

902
01:33:58,781 --> 01:33:59,866
You bastard!

903
01:34:25,975 --> 01:34:27,268
We're almost there.

904
01:34:37,445 --> 01:34:40,114
We arrive at Incheon Port in 15 minutes.

905
01:35:15,316 --> 01:35:16,317
Joon-i.

906
01:35:16,943 --> 01:35:19,737
Is that the boat? Oh, yes!

907
01:35:30,915 --> 01:35:31,958
Yu-jin...

908
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:33,877
Yu-jin, are you okay?

909
01:35:35,169 --> 01:35:36,212
Hi.

910
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:40,591
Joon-i!

911
01:35:43,386 --> 01:35:45,804
Put down your gun! Come on!

912
01:35:47,806 --> 01:35:48,892
Drop it!

913
01:35:49,433 --> 01:35:51,435
Do you want to see her head blown up?

914
01:35:51,519 --> 01:35:52,603
Put it down!

915
01:35:57,650 --> 01:36:00,069
Kick it! Kick it away!

916
01:36:00,987 --> 01:36:02,405
Yes, that's it.

917
01:36:06,409 --> 01:36:08,494
I can finally get off this peninsula...

918
01:36:09,203 --> 01:36:14,250
When I leave, I'm going to live
to the fullest in Hong Kong.

919
01:36:16,627 --> 01:36:19,630
They won't know what I did here.

920
01:36:20,006 --> 01:36:21,966
I'm going to be a good man.

921
01:36:22,716 --> 01:36:26,137
Thank you. Thank you so much.

922
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:27,805
I'll thank you every night.

923
01:36:28,264 --> 01:36:30,433
I really mean it. Thank you so much.

924
01:36:30,516 --> 01:36:32,936
I love you all!

925
01:36:33,019 --> 01:36:34,020
Now!

926
01:36:37,023 --> 01:36:38,024
Okay...

927
01:36:44,113 --> 01:36:45,114
No!

928
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:17,939
Grandpa...

929
01:37:18,898 --> 01:37:21,650
Grandpa, are you okay?

930
01:37:22,026 --> 01:37:23,277
Grandpa...

931
01:37:23,486 --> 01:37:25,071
Mom! Mom...

932
01:37:58,687 --> 01:37:59,772
The sun is rising.

933
01:37:59,856 --> 01:38:00,857
A horde's coming.

934
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,608
We have to depart!

935
01:38:14,537 --> 01:38:15,621
The money's here.

936
01:38:18,917 --> 01:38:19,918
Huh?

937
01:38:21,002 --> 01:38:22,545
It's not him.

938
01:38:24,005 --> 01:38:25,714
How many times did they switch?

939
01:38:28,634 --> 01:38:29,844
Nice to meet you...

940
01:38:30,469 --> 01:38:32,680
- Nice to meet you too.
- Thank you.

941
01:38:40,229 --> 01:38:43,274
Get rid of the body!

942
01:38:57,496 --> 01:39:00,959
Hey, stop!

943
01:39:10,969 --> 01:39:13,888
Get the money!

944
01:39:13,972 --> 01:39:16,891
Shut the back hatch! Zombies are coming!

945
01:39:49,548 --> 01:39:52,260
Grandpa...

946
01:39:54,971 --> 01:39:57,849
Okay, I'm okay...

947
01:39:58,349 --> 01:40:00,601
Grandpa...

948
01:40:04,438 --> 01:40:07,441
I wanted to pull you out of this hell...

949
01:40:10,694 --> 01:40:11,863
No...

950
01:40:13,322 --> 01:40:16,034
We were together all along.

951
01:40:17,493 --> 01:40:19,495
Why would this be hell?

952
01:40:21,539 --> 01:40:22,581
Thank you...

953
01:40:23,499 --> 01:40:25,418
Grandpa...

954
01:40:29,463 --> 01:40:31,090
Grandpa!

955
01:40:32,675 --> 01:40:34,135
I'm sorry...

956
01:40:35,636 --> 01:40:37,931
for making you live in this world...

957
01:40:38,306 --> 01:40:40,433
Grandpa...

958
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:45,897
- Grandpa...
- I'm sorry...

959
01:40:46,147 --> 01:40:47,565
Grandpa.

960
01:40:53,154 --> 01:40:54,613
Grandpa!

961
01:40:59,743 --> 01:41:01,495
Don't die...

962
01:41:06,584 --> 01:41:09,295
Grandpa! No!

963
01:41:11,714 --> 01:41:13,257
Grandpa...

964
01:41:53,839 --> 01:41:55,549
Girls! The fireworks!

965
01:41:55,633 --> 01:41:56,675
Hurry!

966
01:41:58,136 --> 01:41:59,137
Joon-i!

967
01:42:05,726 --> 01:42:09,147
You promised to do a favor for me.

968
01:42:10,481 --> 01:42:13,442
Take the girls with you no matter what.

969
01:42:14,277 --> 01:42:15,319
Got it?

970
01:42:15,653 --> 01:42:16,654
Promise me, okay?

971
01:42:17,405 --> 01:42:18,447
Get going!

972
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:20,241
Now!

973
01:42:34,672 --> 01:42:37,800
Commander, thank you.

974
01:43:25,139 --> 01:43:27,391
Mom's falling behind!

975
01:44:29,537 --> 01:44:30,704
Are you all right?

976
01:44:30,914 --> 01:44:32,081
You're safe now!

977
01:44:35,834 --> 01:44:36,835
Jane...

978
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:37,921
Jane!

979
01:44:38,004 --> 01:44:40,965
Jane! We have to save my mom!

980
01:44:41,049 --> 01:44:42,383
I'm sorry. It's too late!

981
01:44:42,466 --> 01:44:43,676
We can't put you in danger.

982
01:44:43,759 --> 01:44:44,844
We must leave now!

983
01:44:44,928 --> 01:44:47,680
Please, help my mom!

984
01:44:48,389 --> 01:44:49,891
Please! Just this once!

985
01:44:50,058 --> 01:44:51,059
Go! Let's go!

986
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:52,351
Let's go!

987
01:44:52,435 --> 01:44:53,602
You must wait!

988
01:44:56,314 --> 01:44:57,356
Please...

989
01:44:58,942 --> 01:45:00,902
Remain calm...

990
01:45:11,287 --> 01:45:12,663
Don't wait for me...

991
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:37,981
No...

992
01:45:39,398 --> 01:45:40,399
Mom!

993
01:45:40,483 --> 01:45:43,277
Don't do it, Mom!

994
01:45:52,703 --> 01:45:53,746
Let go of me!

995
01:45:57,375 --> 01:45:58,376
Mom!

996
01:46:07,510 --> 01:46:09,137
Mom, please!

997
01:46:17,228 --> 01:46:20,023
She made a very sensible decision.

998
01:46:20,689 --> 01:46:24,568
It was for the best! For everyone...

999
01:46:25,694 --> 01:46:27,363
Sensible decision, my ass.

1000
01:46:29,407 --> 01:46:30,574
Did you even try?

1001
01:46:33,369 --> 01:46:34,370
Jung-seok...

1002
01:46:35,746 --> 01:46:37,248
You're tormented too!

1003
01:46:38,958 --> 01:46:40,293
You just gave up!

1004
01:46:40,376 --> 01:46:43,004
We have to save Mom!

1005
01:46:49,969 --> 01:46:51,554
I'll bring back your mom.

1006
01:46:52,763 --> 01:46:53,973
Wait right here.

1007
01:47:05,985 --> 01:47:08,196
Mom! Run!

1008
01:48:39,328 --> 01:48:41,705
- Mom!
- Mom!

1009
01:48:49,297 --> 01:48:50,298
Mom!

1010
01:50:07,291 --> 01:50:10,128
Don't worry. She'll be okay.

1011
01:50:14,883 --> 01:50:16,175
She'll be fine.

1012
01:50:30,023 --> 01:50:32,733
In a few hours, a new world will be waiting.

1013
01:50:34,527 --> 01:50:38,281
The world I knew wasn't bad either.

1014
01:50:59,750 --> 01:51:07,800

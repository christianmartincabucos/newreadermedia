                            <p>My name is Dr. Charles G. Glenn.  I was married to my lovely wife the late Janet L. Glenn for 45 wonderful years. We have three sons, one daughter, and six grandchildren.  I was born in Shreveport, Louisiana but now reside in San Diego, California.  I received the Lord at the age of twenty, and God also called me into ministry at the age of twenty.  I am the proud Pastor of King of Kings Temple C.O.G.I.C., San Diego, California.</p>

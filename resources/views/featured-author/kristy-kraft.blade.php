                            <p>A young boy sets out to find adventure, not realizing what else he will find!  Even at his young age, he serves as a good influence on others with his generous heart.  He recognizes and appreciates God’s presence in his life, on the seas and upon returning home.  Come set sail with Eric to learn about True Treasure…</p>
                            <p>Originally told as a bedtime story to her young boys while at Smith Mountain Lake, VA, True Treasure has a Christian theme tucked into this adventure at sea.  (After the boys were asleep, Kraft ran to the table to write it all down and has kept it much as it was told.)</p>
                            <p>Adam, Kristy’s middle son, heard the story at age 4 1/2 while camping out in the living room with his older brother on a new inflatable raft island, complete with a palm tree and treasure chest!  He grew up to be a fine artist, and so was asked to illustrate his mother’s story.  He completed his detailed drawings just before heading off to college.</p>

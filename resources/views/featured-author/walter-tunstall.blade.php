                            <p>On the Origin of Dignity: Its Creation and Enhancement describes where our dignity, our sense of self-worth, comes from and how we get it. The book moves beyond thousands of years of time-honored convention to provide a new and alternative understanding of dignity that does not depend upon social norms, or philosophical and religious traditions. On the Origin of Dignity demonstrates how previous beliefs about dignity are the result of an underlying and dynamic co-creative interpersonal process that occurs when we interact with one another. With an understanding of this process we can become conscious and deliberate creators of not only our own dignity but the dignity of others as well.</p>

                            <p>Rosa Martinez is seriously ill. She has the loving support of her mother and grandfather and a doctor who takes good care of her. But she also has a secret weapon. Rosa can summon five tigers to come to her aid when she’s ailing or in big trouble. Her disease may think it has the upper hand, but wait until it encounters Gautama, Arik, Vashti, Selena and Quan – the five fierce tigers of Rosa Martinez. Young readers will delight in their daring adventures and who knows: they may even be able to call forth guardian animals of their own when they need them.</p>

                            <p>A magical tale of friendship and adventure... When Princess Ariadne and her best friend Dooby the penguin are accidently transported from the magical world of Micheland to the world of humans, they know they're in trouble. But then they meet Danielle, a friendly young girl about Princess Ariadne's age who volunteers to help them find their way back home. As they search for a portal that can return them to their world, Princess Ariadne, Dooby, and Danielle take on bullying and disrespect for elders, and perform a heroic act. Together, they discover that their new friendship is truly magical!</p>

                            <p>What had started as a search for his father has suddenly become troubled with deceit and conspiracy, as a lad finds himself, instead. The brazen act of Creech Jones' alarming circumstances comes from hatred, pride and revenge. Success smiles upon Creech Jones; prestige and privilege accompany him. But on the inside, there is a void, a deep dissatisfaction, as he suffers a slow agonizing death. Then a casual interest in his parents' separation and his family disintegration develops into an obsession with revenge that impelled him eventually to act on his fantasies, perhaps in a criminal way. The visit to his father's house was supposed to be a beneficial association. But the surprise trip turns bitter when the prodigal son returns home under a different identity to betray his family. Creech Jones' reason for visiting the saltbox is his biggest secret, followed by frustration, humiliation - and then destruction. The Saltbox is a tale of what a person's stamina can bear, and what his intention can attain. What results is a forewarning account about guilt, responsibility and how jealousy can tear a loving family apart. The Saltbox has mystery, an atmosphere of quiet bullying and much realistically viewed life.</p>

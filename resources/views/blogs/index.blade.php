But people who were treated there claimed to have a certain feeling of dread as soon as they wake up. Others often heard voices, felt as if they were being watched and noticed shadows from the corners of their eyes. Some claimed to be pushed around by invisible entities, saw a mysterious woman shrouded in a very dark aura and even dreamed of being tortured by people in uniform. No one was comfortable.</span></p>

Its poor living conditions and the lack of patients led the asylum to cease its operations in 1970. Former patients continued to reside in its walls, basking in the violence and inhumane treatment from both their fellow patients and staff.</span></p>

But within the abandoned structure, they say s</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">pirits of the deceased continue to haunt the place in the form of talking dolls, large black apparitions and red glowing eyes.</span></p>

                            <p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">One of the hospital&rsquo;s caretakers shared stories of seeing and feeling inexplicable things. With the lights on, he&rsquo;s sure he&rsquo;s alone but as soon as he turns the lights off, he starts seeing shadowy figures glide through the halls. Many are often dressed as patients. One particular section in the hospital, wherein a staircase with a glass-paned door is kept closed and off-limits at all times. Yet every night, caretakers can hear a definitive tap on the door. As if someone, or something, is tapping it at the exact same time and exact same place. If there&rsquo;s anything untrue to the stories you&rsquo;ve read so far, it&rsquo;s the tapping that stays constant.</span></p>

Others often heard voices, felt as if they were being watched and noticed shadows from the corners of their eyes. Some claimed to be pushed around by invisible entities, saw a mysterious woman shrouded in a very dark aura and even dreamed of being tortured by people in uniform. No one was comfortable.</span></p>

With the lights on, he&rsquo;s sure he&rsquo;s alone but as soon as he turns the lights off, he starts seeing shadowy figures glide through the halls. Many are often dressed as patients. One particular section in the hospital, wherein a staircase with a glass-paned door is kept closed and off-limits at all times. Yet every night, caretakers can hear a definitive tap on the door. As if someone, or something, is tapping it at the exact same time and exact same place. If there&rsquo;s anything untrue to the stories you&rsquo;ve read so far, it&rsquo;s the tapping that stays constant.</span></p>

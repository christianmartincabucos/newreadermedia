                            <p>Who goes to bookstores anymore? Nowadays one can simply get a book online and have it delivered to the doorstep. E-books? Audiobooks? And shall I say, pirated books?</p>
                            <p>But there&rsquo;s something that bookstores offer that&rsquo;s better than convenience. It&rsquo;s the <em>experience </em>itself. You can call it <em>cheesy, </em>but really, there&rsquo;s more to it.</p>
